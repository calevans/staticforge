# siteconfig.yaml - Site-wide configuration for StaticForge
#
# This file contains non-sensitive site configuration that can be
# safely committed to version control. Unlike .env (which contains
# credentials and environment-specific settings like SITE_BASE_URL),
# this file contains site information, menu definitions, and other
# site-wide settings.
#
# This file is OPTIONAL - StaticForge works fine without it.

# Site Information
# These appear in templates and throughout your site
site:
  name: "My Awesome Site"
  tagline: "Building amazing things with PHP"

# Static menu definitions
# These create named menus accessible in templates as {{ menu_name }}
menu:
  # Main navigation menu
  # Accessible in templates as {{ menu_top }}
  top:
    Home: /
    About: /about
    Products: /products
    Shop: /shop
    Contact: /contact

  # Footer navigation
  # Accessible in templates as {{ menu_footer }}
  footer:
    Privacy Policy: /privacy
    Terms of Service: /terms
    Contact Us: /contact
    Sitemap: /sitemap

# Chapter navigation configuration
# Controls sequential navigation links (prev/next) within menu sections
chapter_nav:
  # Comma-separated list of menu numbers to generate chapter navigation for
  # Example: "2" enables chapter nav for menu 2, "2,3" enables for menus 2 and 3
  menus: "2"

  # Symbol for "previous" link (default: ←)
  prev_symbol: "←"

  # Symbol for "next" link (default: →)
  next_symbol: "→"

  # Separator between navigation elements (default: |)
  separator: "|"

# Future: Additional site-wide settings can be added here
# Examples:

# description: "A great site built with StaticForge"
# default_author: "John Doe"
# social_links:
#   twitter: https://twitter.com/mysite
#   github: https://github.com/mysite
