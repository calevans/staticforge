# siteconfig.yaml - Site-wide configuration for StaticForge
#
# This file contains non-sensitive site configuration that can be
# safely committed to version control. Unlike .env (which contains
# credentials and environment-specific settings like SITE_BASE_URL),
# this file contains site information, menu definitions, and other
# site-wide settings.
#
# This file is OPTIONAL - StaticForge works fine without it.

# Site Information
# These appear in templates and throughout your site
site:
  name: "My Awesome Site"
  tagline: "Built with ❤️ and PHP"

# Static menu definitions
# These create named menus accessible in templates as {{ menu_name }}
menu:
  # Main navigation menu
  # Accessible in templates as {{ menu_top }}

# Chapter navigation configuration
# Controls sequential navigation links (prev/next) within menu sections
chapter_nav:
  # Comma-separated list of menu numbers to generate chapter navigation for
  # Example: "2" enables chapter nav for menu 2, "2,3" enables for menus 2 and 3
  menus: "2"

  # Symbol for "previous" link (default: ←)
  prev_symbol: "←"

  # Symbol for "next" link (default: →)
  next_symbol: "→"

    # Base URL for form submission
    provider_url: "https://eicc.com/f/"
