# siteconfig.yaml - Site-wide configuration for StaticForge
#
# This file contains non-sensitive site configuration that can be
# safely committed to version control. Unlike .env (which contains
# credentials and environment-specific settings like SITE_BASE_URL),
# this file contains site information, menu definitions, and other
# site-wide settings.
#
# This file is OPTIONAL - StaticForge works fine without it.

# Site Information
# These appear in templates and throughout your site
site:
  name: "My Awesome Site"
  tagline: "Built with ❤️ and PHP"
  template: "sample"

# Social Metadata Defaults
# Used by the SocialMetadata feature to generate Open Graph and Twitter cards
social:
  twitter_handle: "@yourhandle"
  default_image: "/assets/images/default-social.jpg"

# Static menu definitions
# These create named menus accessible in templates as {{ menu_name }}
menu:
  # Main navigation menu
  # Accessible in templates as {{ menu_top }}
  top:
    Home: /

  # Footer navigation
  # Accessible in templates as {{ menu_footer }}
  footer:

# Chapter navigation configuration
# Controls sequential navigation links (prev/next) within menu sections
chapter_nav:
  # Comma-separated list of menu numbers to generate chapter navigation for
  # Example: "2" enables chapter nav for menu 2, "2,3" enables for menus 2 and 3
  menus: "2"

  # Symbol for "previous" link (default: ←)
  prev_symbol: "←"

  # Symbol for "next" link (default: →)
  next_symbol: "→"

# Search Configuration
search:
  # Search engine to use: 'minisearch' (default) or 'fuse'
  # minisearch: Faster for exact matches and prefix search
  # fuse: Better fuzzy matching (typo tolerance)
  engine: minisearch

  # Separator between navigation elements (default: |)
  separator: "|"

  enabled: true
  # Paths to exclude from the search index (e.g., list pages)
  exclude_paths:
    - /tags/
    - /categories/
  # Content directories to exclude entirely (e.g., private docs)
  exclude_content_in: []

# Forms Configuration
# Define forms that can be embedded using {{ form('name') }}
forms:
  contact:
    # Optional: Use a custom template (e.g., templates/active_template/contact_us.html.twig)
    # template: contact_us

    # Base URL for form submission
    provider_url: "https://eicc.com/f/"

    # Unique Form ID (appended to provider_url as ?FORMID=YOUR_ID)
    form_id: "YOUR_FORM_ID"

    # Optional: Altcha Spam Protection URL
    # challenge_url: "https://your-altcha-server.com/challenge"

    success_message: "Thanks! We've received your message."
