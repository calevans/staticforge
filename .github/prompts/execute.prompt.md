Annonce that you are about to execute step {{step}}.
Review {{step}} in documents/prompt.md so that you understand it.

Ask me any questions you have, one at a time, to clarify the task before you start. Only ask questions that are strictly necessary to clarify the task. Do not make any assumptions about what I want; always ask if unsure.

Once you understand, execute {{step}}.
