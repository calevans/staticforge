description: PHP specific instructions
applyTo: '**/*.php'
---
- Target the version of php specified in composer.json.
- Implement all new features from the specified version of php as is reasonable.
- Use the latest stable version of PHPUnit for testing.
- Use EICC\Utils for logging and utility functions.
- We use Doctrine DBAL for database layer.
- Before installing a package, make sure that we aren't already using it or something similar.
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards for PHP (PSR-2 is deprecated).
- Do not use static methods unless there is no other way to achieve the same functionality.
- Use meaningful variable and function names - avoid abbreviations and single letters except for standard iterators.
- Write docblocks for all public methods, classes, and properties using proper PHPDoc syntax.
- Include @param, @return, @throws annotations in docblocks.
- Prefer explicit over implicit code - be clear about types and intentions.
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks and meaningful error messages.
- Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1) at the top of all PHP files.
- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types.
- Use nullable types (?string) instead of union types where appropriate.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user data.
- Use prepared statements for all database queries via Doctrine DBAL.
- Use transactions for multi-step database operations.
- Implement proper error logging using EICC\Utils with appropriate log levels.
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings - define them as class constants or global constants.
- Follow single responsibility principle - one class, one purpose.
- Use dependency injection instead of global variables or singletons.
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exception classes when needed.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability.
- Validate method inputs at the beginning of methods.
- Leverage PHP 8+ features like match expressions, named arguments, and constructor property promotion.
- Use readonly properties for immutable data (PHP 8.1+).
- Use enums instead of class constants for fixed sets of values (PHP 8.1+).
- Implement proper namespace usage - one class per file, namespace matches directory structure.
- Use composer autoloading - never use require/include for classes.
- Write unit tests for all public methods with meaningful test names.
- All business logic should have meaningful, not superficial unit tests.
- Use data providers for testing multiple scenarios.
- Mock external dependencies in tests using PHPUnit's mocking framework.
- Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces, no tabs).
- Keep line length under 120 characters.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line arrays and function calls.
- Add return type declarations even for void methods.
- Use arrow functions for simple callbacks when appropriate.
- Implement proper memory management - unset large variables when done.
- Use generators for large datasets to avoid memory issues.
- Cache expensive operations when possible.
- Document complex business logic with inline comments.
- Use meaningful commit messages when updating code.
- If a variable is only going to be used once, don't create a variable, just use the value unless that is not possible.
