# Getting Started with StaticForge

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on building static sites with **StaticForge**, a powerful PHP-based static site generator.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to install and configure StaticForge
- Creating content with Markdown

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- PHP 8.4 or higher installed
- Composer for dependency management
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- A text editor of your choice

```

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file:

```

Edit `.env` to configure your site:

```bash
CONTENT_PATH=content/
OUTPUT_PATH=public/

```

## Creating Content

Create your first content file at `content/hello.md`:

```markdown
---
title = "Hello World"
description = "My first post"
tags = [hello, first-post]
---

# Hello World!

This is my first post with StaticForge.
```
