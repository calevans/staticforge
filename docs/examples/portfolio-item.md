# E-Commerce Platform Redesign

A complete modernization of a legacy e-commerce platform, resulting in 40% faster page loads and 25% increase in conversions.

## Project Overview

**Client**: RetailCo Inc.
**Duration**: 6 months
**Team Size**: 5 developers
**Budget**: $150,000

## Challenge

RetailCo's existing e-commerce platform was built in 2010 and suffered from:

- Slow page load times (5-8 seconds)
- Poor mobile experience
- Outdated checkout flow
- Difficult to maintain codebase
- No integration with modern payment gateways

The company was losing customers to competitors with better online experiences.

## Solution

We designed and implemented a complete platform redesign with:

### Technical Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.4 with Laravel framework
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with Redis caching
- **Hosting**: AWS with CloudFront CDN
- **Payments**: Stripe and PayPal integration

### Key Features

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Server-side rendering for critical pages
   - Redis caching layer
   - CDN for static assets
   - Optimized database queries
   - Image lazy loading and WebP format

2. **Mobile-First Design**
   - Responsive design across all breakpoints
   - Touch-optimized interface
   - Progressive Web App capabilities
   - Offline browsing support

3. **Improved Checkout**
   - One-page checkout process
   - Guest checkout option
   - Multiple payment methods
   - Address autocomplete
   - Real-time shipping calculations

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Real-time analytics
   - Inventory management
   - Order processing workflow
   - Customer insights
   - Marketing automation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     CDN (CloudFront)           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Load Balancer              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Web Servers (EC2)          │
│     - PHP-FPM                  │
│     - Nginx                    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓
┌────────────────┬────────────────┐
│  Database (RDS)│  Cache (Redis) │
└────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

### Code Quality
