Welcome to the showroom. While the documentation tells you how the engine works, sometimes you just want to see the car drive.

We've included a collection of example files in the `content/examples/` directory of your project. These aren't just placeholders; they are fully functional pages generated by StaticForge during the build process. They demonstrate different content types, layouts, and features in action.

## Live Demos

Click through to see how StaticForge renders different types of content:

*   [**Blog Post**](/examples/tutorials/blog-post.html)
    A classic blog layout complete with tags, author metadata, and reading time calculations.
*   [**Documentation Page**](/examples/documentation/documentation-page.html)
    A technical guide layout featuring syntax-highlighted code blocks and alert boxes.
*   [**Portfolio Item**](/examples/portfolio/portfolio-item.html)
    A visual-heavy layout designed to showcase projects or case studies.
*   [**RSS Enabled Article**](/examples/tutorials/rss-enabled-article.html)
    An example of content that automatically gets picked up by the RSS feed generator.
*   [**Shortcodes Demo**](/examples/docs-examples/shortcodes.html)
    See our built-in shortcodes in action—embedding YouTube videos, Tweets, and GitHub Gists with ease.
*   [**Simple Page**](/examples/simple-page.html)
    The bare necessities. A minimal page showing that you don't need complex metadata to get a page online.
*   [**Landing Page**](/examples/landing-page.html)
    A raw HTML page that bypasses the standard Markdown processing, perfect for custom landing pages.

## Steal These Blueprints

The best way to learn is to tinker. These examples are designed to be copied and modified. Think of them as blueprints we've left on the workbench for you.

Want to start a blog? Don't start from scratch. Grab the blog post example and make it your own:

```bash
# Copy the blog post blueprint to your blog directory
cp content/examples/blog-post.md content/blog/my-first-post.md
```

Once you've copied a file, open it up and play with the FrontMatter. Change the `template`, tweak the `category`, and see how the StaticForge engine responds on your next build.
