# Privacy Policy

Let's keep this simple.

We believe that privacy is important. Because of that, we built this site differently than most of the web.

## WHAT WE COLLECT

**Minimal Data.**

We respect your privacy and only collect what is necessary to improve this site.

*   **Analytics:** We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with our site. This helps us improve the content and user experience.
*   **Cookies:** This site uses cookies to support Google Analytics. We do not use cookies for any other purpose.

## THE CONTACT FORM

If you use the contact form to send us a message, we will obviously receive your name, email address, and whatever you type in the message box.

*   We use this information only to read your message and reply to you.
*   We do not add you to any marketing lists.
*   We do not sell, trade, or give your information to anyone else.

## EXTERNAL LINKS

Sometimes we link to other websites (like YouTube, GitHub, or other projects). Once you leave this site, we can't control what those other sites do. Please check their privacy policies if you're concerned.

## CHANGES

If we ever decide to change this policy, we will update this page clearly.
