# Robots.txt Generator

**What it does:** Automatically generates a `robots.txt` file to control search engine crawling

**File types:** Works with all content files (`.md`, `.html`) and category definition files

**Events:**
- `POST_GLOB` (priority 150) - Scans files for robots metadata
- `POST_LOOP` (priority 100) - Generates robots.txt file

## How It Works

1. Scans all content files for `robots` metadata during site generation
2. Collects paths that should be disallowed
3. Generates `robots.txt` in the output directory after processing all files
4. Automatically includes sitemap reference if `SITE_BASE_URL` is configured

## Controlling Individual Pages

Add `robots` field to any content file's frontmatter:

### Disallow a Page (robots=no)

```markdown
---
title: "Private Page"
robots: "no"
---

# This page won't be crawled by search engines

This content is hidden from search engines via robots.txt.
```

### Allow a Page (robots=yes or omit field)

```markdown
---
title: "Public Page"
robots: "yes"
---

# This page is visible to search engines

Default behavior - search engines can crawl this page.
```

## Controlling Entire Categories

Create a category definition file with `type=category` and `robots=no`:

```markdown
---
type: category
category: private
title: "Private Category"
robots: "no"
---

# Private Category

All files in this category will be disallowed in robots.txt.
```

## Generated Robots.txt Examples

### When You Have Pages with robots=no

```
# robots.txt generated by StaticForge
# 2025-01-15 10:30:00

User-agent: *
Disallow: /private-page.html
Disallow: /secret.html
Disallow: /private-category/

# Sitemap location
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

### When All Pages Are Allowed

```
# robots.txt generated by StaticForge
# 2025-01-15 10:30:00

User-agent: *
# No disallowed paths
Disallow:

# Sitemap location
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic:** robots.txt is generated on every site build
- **Smart defaults:** Pages without `robots` field default to "yes" (allow)
- **Case insensitive:** `robots="NO"`, `robots="No"`, and `robots="no"` all work
- **Category support:** Disallow entire categories via category definition files
- **Sorted output:** Paths are alphabetically sorted for consistency
- **Sitemap reference:** Automatically includes sitemap URL if configured

## Configuration

No configuration needed! The feature uses `SITE_BASE_URL` from your `.env` file:

```ini
# .env
SITE_BASE_URL="https://example.com"
```

## Why Use This Feature

- **Privacy:** Keep development/internal pages out of search results
- **SEO control:** Prevent duplicate content issues
- **Compliance:** Follow SEO best practices automatically
- **No manual work:** robots.txt updates automatically when you add/remove pages

## Important Notes

- robots.txt is a *suggestion* to search engines, not enforcement
- For real security, use authentication or don't publish sensitive content
- The feature generates `robots.txt` in your output directory on every build
- Changes take effect when you deploy the updated robots.txt file
