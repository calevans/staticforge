# Welcome to StaticForge

Congratulations! You've successfully installed StaticForge, a PHP-based static site generator with an extensible, event-driven architecture.

## What is StaticForge?

StaticForge transforms your content files (Markdown, HTML) into a complete static website that can be deployed anywhere. It's built by PHP developers, for PHP developers, making it easy to extend and customize.

## Quick Start

Your site is already set up and ready to generate! Here's what to do next:

1. **Edit your site configuration** - Open `.env` and customize your site settings
2. **Add your content** - Create `.md` or `.html` files in the `content/` directory
3. **Generate your site** - Run: `php bin/console.php render:site`
4. **View your site** - Open files in the `output/` directory

## Available Templates

StaticForge comes with 4 pre-built templates. Switch between them by editing the `TEMPLATE` variable in your `.env` file:

- **sample** (current) - Clean, minimal design
- **staticforce** - Professional documentation theme
- **terminal** - Retro terminal-inspired design
- **vaulttech** - Fallout-inspired post-apocalyptic theme
