Promt:
We are writing the encyclopedia of home bar-tending. The target audience is home bartenders that want to be able to mix drinks with flare, understand a bit about the chemistry of bar-tending, and be able to impress their friends at parties with this skill, knowledge, and technique. We are not teaching professional bartenders. They are not looking to be professionals, and they are not Tom Cruise and Brian Brown in Cocktail. Along the way it's ok to include a drink recipie when needed to demonstrate but this is not a recipie book.

You are writing the article described below. It should be complete and thorough. It should be least 1,500 words long, but with a Quick Start section near the beginning for the impatient.

Use https://heartsntales.com/about-us for tone and style. Do not copy text from there. 

All copy should be written so that it is not simply copied from other texts. 

After generating the article, generate a midjourney prompt to generate an image to go with it. Be as detailed with the midjourney prompt as needed to generate the image. 

The very tip of the article should be the forecontent. It is in key=value format. It is deliniated by a pair of lines --- above and below it. It should contain 2 things.
